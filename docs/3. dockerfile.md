# dockerfile

## The order of generating docker images

```dockerfile
# Specify image:version
FROM node:10

# Specify where the file is generated
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy src to docker conainer dest
# If you want to use package.json, you have to copy package.json
# to docker container directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Run commads when build image
RUN npm install

# After install node packages, you have to copy those packages to
# docker container directory to use it
COPY . .

# Even though you write the EXPOSE, you have to specify port mapping using -p option
# when you run the docker command.(docker -p 80:8080)
EXPOSE 8080

# Run commands when executing container
CMD [ "node" ,"server.js"]
```



## When error said there is no package.json

  Because container is the independent place container cannot access other files such as package.json placed on the host outside the container.



## The reason why you can't access the application with the generated image. (port mapping)

A command to run the docker container for now

```shell
$ docker run <image name>
```

A command to run the docker container from now on

```shell
$ docker run -p 80:8080 <image name>
```

You can access the server with port(80) left of colon(:) and docker mapping the port with a port(8080) right of colon(:). The server in the container runs on port 8080



## Why specify Working Directory?

```dockerfile
# Specify where the file is generated
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .
```

* If there are files same name as the copied file, it could overwrite the existed files.
* All the files are in one directory, so it's not organized enough.





## Docker Volume

```shell
$ docker run -p 5000:8080 -v /usr/src/app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app <image id>
```

If you want to reflect on modifications immediately, you can use **docker volume** with option -v.

If you use -v  option with just one path, for example **-v /usr/src/app/node_module**s, the container doesn't mapping that directory on host. And if you use -v option with colon(:), for example **-v $(pwd):/usr/src/app/** , the container mapping $(pwd) path on host with /usr/src/app on the docker container.
