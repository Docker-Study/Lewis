# Nginx



## Why Nginx?

Tools for development are useless on production server, because it's too heavy to operate the server. So Nginx server is more appropriate than development server for production server because Nginx server has no feactures for development server.



## Dockerfile

  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:alpine as builder
  WORKDIR '/usr/src/app'
  COPY package.json .
  RUN npm install
  COPY ./ ./
  RUN npm run build
  
  FROM nginx
  EXPOSE 80
  COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
  ```

  <table>
      <thead>
          <th>항목</th>
          <th>의미</th>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
              <td style="width:260px;">FROM node:alpine as builder</td>
              <td><strong>as builder</strong> specify this stage is builder stage</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td style="width:260px;">COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html</td>
              <td>When you copy <strong>--from=buider</strong> specify /usr/src/app build is from builder</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td style="width:260px;">/usr/share/nginx/html</td>
              <td>You have to copy builder files to the paht above so that the server will work</td>
          </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>

1. Builder Stage : Create buider files
2. Run Stage : Run the Nginx and provide clients the created builder files from first stage by request of web browser
