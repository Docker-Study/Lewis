Docker is basically managed independently as a container, so each can't access to each other. If you want to connect A container with B container, you have to write **docker-compose.yml** file and use **docker-compose** command.



## redis-serer

```javascript
const client = redis.createClient({
  host: "redis-server",
  port: 6379,
});
```

You give a host option where the Redis server is running as above by URL in non-docker environment but when using docker-compose you should give a host option as the container name specified docker-compose.yml file.



## docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  redis-server:
    image: "redis"
  node-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:8080"

```

## docker-compose commands

* docker-compose build : It only build image and doesn't execute the container.
* docker-compose up : Only if image doesn't exist docker build a image and execute the container
* docker-compose up --build : It doesn't matter weather image is or not and execute the container.
* docker-compose up --no-build : Without building a image execute a container (If there is no image, it could fail)
